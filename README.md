# National-Assembly-Service-Commission-Staff-Non-Interest-Cooperative-Society-NASCS-NICS-Managemen
This project is a contribution scheme developed for National Assembly Service Commission Staff Non-Interest Cooperative Society.Its major aim is to capture individuals who are registered under the scheme. You can save cash and receive at an expected period. I sometimes call this a mini bank app but has alot more. This project was abit challenging for me because 90% of the work was done from a scratch .So much brain storming.
